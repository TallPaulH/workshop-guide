## <a id="welcome"></a>Welcome to the Lab Guide

This guide is aimed at participants in a Delphix guided workshop for the purposes of evaluating the Delphix Data Platform. 
It is supplemental to the Delphix POC environment, and provides several exercises to perform throughout the workshop. If you encounter any issues during the exercises, please do not hesitate to ask your Solution Engineer for advice.

During the workshop you are free to go beyond the exercises provided to test the capabilities of the platform.
